"You are a senior Java engineer. In the current working directory there are multiple directories named vuln_<name>.\n"
"For each vuln_<name> directory that contains a source file at source/vul_<name>.java and a review file named review.json located inside the same vuln_<name> directory, produce a corrected Java source file and write it to a file named fixed.java inside that vuln_<name> directory.\n"
"Do not output any extra text or explanations. Only perform the fixes and write the files. If a vuln directory lacks a review file, skip it.\n"
